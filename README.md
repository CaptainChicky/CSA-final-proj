# Comp Sci A Final Project
This is the final project for our AP CSA class.

# Structure
## Main
 - *RSA_main* folder contains all the RSA python code. Within main is all the functions, and the keygen, decrypt, and encrypt contain the driver programs.
 - *server.py* contains the flask server file, *static* folder is the styling and js for the *templates* folder html files of the chat room. Both devices must be connected via LAN (same network that has a group policy that doesn't block LAN connections aka iPhone hotspots or home wifi, and not school wifi) to be able to see packets sent by the eventlet flask server. Access the server via the hosting device's IP address on port 8081.
## Other
 - *java-tmp* folder is just files when we experimented with RSA in java.

## Note for closure
*static/style.css* has linked google fonts. If the fonts breaks in who knows how many years from now, then check those links.
