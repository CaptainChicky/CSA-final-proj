# Structure
## Main
 - *RSA_main* folder contains all the RSA python code. Within main is all the functions, and the keygen, decrypt, and encrypt contain the driver programs.
 - *server.py* contains the flask server file, *static* folder is the styling and js for the *templates* folder html files of the chat room. Both devices must be connected via LAN (same network that has a group policy that doesn't block LAN connections aka iPhone hotspots or home wifi, and not school wifi) to be able to see packets sent by the eventlet flask server.
## Other
 - *\_\_pycache\_\_* folder is just the python generated binaries for the server.
 - *java-tmp* folder is just files when we experimented with RSA in java.
